# ML Side Project

Using historical stock data, train ML model to buy and sell stocks for fun (probably) and profit (if it works).

Stages:
 - [in progress] Structure out the code
 - [finished] Get internet stock data to work
 - [finished] Get generated stock data to work
 - [not started] Add real data offline storage
 - [not started] Figure out tensorFlow for this project
 - [not started] Figure out math for this project
 - [not started] Figure out simulation and simple training
 - [not started] Figure out simulation graph output
 - [not started] Do proof of concept using generated stock data
 - [not started] Figure out training with randomly generated agents 
 - [not started] Start training ml agents
 - [not started] While training ml agents, simulate them in real world
 - [not started] If they work out, have some profit
 - [not started] Try moving everything to the cloud, and ramp-up the nn complexity
